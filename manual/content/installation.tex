\section{Installation}
The only requirement is Blender 2.70 or newer. You can install neverblender
like every other add-on from blenders User Preferences under the Add-Ons tab.
Select Install from file at the bottom and select the downloaded zip file. \\

Alternatively you can install manually by unzipping the contents of the
downloaded zip and placing the neverblender folder into the scripts/addons
directory of your Blender directory.
