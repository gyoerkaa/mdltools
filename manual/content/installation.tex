\chapter{Installation}
The only requirement is Blender 2.70 or newer. You can install Neverblender
like every other add-on: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open User Preferences (\textit{Ctrl}+\textit{Alt}+\textit{U}) and under Add-ons, 
click Install from File. Then navigate to the file you downloaded and select it.
\item It should now appear in the window and you can tick the checkbox in the upper right to enable it.
\item To have the add-on enabled every time you start Blender, click Save User Settings at the bottom.
\end{enumerate}

Alternatively you may install manually by extracting the contents of the
downloaded archive and placing the Neverblender folder into the scripts/addons
directory of your Blender installation.
