\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Installation}
The only requirement is Blender 2.70 or newer. Neverblender can be installed
like every other add-on: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open User Preferences (\textit{Ctrl}+\textit{Alt}+\textit{U}) and under Add-ons, 
click Install from File. Then navigate to the file you downloaded and select it.
\item It should now appear in the window and you can tick the checkbox in the upper right to enable it.
\item To have the add-on enabled every time you start Blender, click Save User Settings at the bottom.
\end{enumerate}

Alternatively manual installation is possible by extracting the contents of the
downloaded archive and placing the Neverblender folder in Blender's \textit{scripts/addons} directory.\\

\section{User Interface}
Once installed, additional entries are available in Blender's File menu: \textit{Import > Aurora (.mdl)} and 
\textit{Export > Aurora (.mdl)}. Furthermore several new panels are added to the Object Properties window:
\begin{itemize}
\item Aurora Root Properties: For Empties without a parent.
\item Aurora Dummy Properties: For Empties with parents.
\item Aurora Mesh Properties: For Meshes.
\item Aurora Animation Properties: Whenever an object belonging to an MDL is selected.
\item Aurora Utilities: Whenever an object belonging to an MDL is selected.
\end{itemize}
