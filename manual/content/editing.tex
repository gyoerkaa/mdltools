\section{Editing}
There are three types of objects which can be exported as mdl: Empties,
Meshes and Lamps. Other objects like curves and surfaces will have to be
converted to meshes before attempting to export them.

\subsection{Empties}
Empties appear in mdl files as Dummies. Like in blender they are used to group
objects. In addition there are special types of Dummies which for
example indicate locations for spells effects.

\subsubsection{Dummy}
Simple Empties/Dummies with a parent are either used to group objects or
indicate a special location for the engine. If a Dummy doesn't have a
parent it is considered to be a {\textit{Rootdummy}} instead of a simple Dummy
and the available options will change.

\begin{description}
    \item[None] Simple dummy without any special purpose.
    \item[Ground] Indicates the ground level for spells/ visual effects
    \item[Impact] Impact target for most spells/ visual effects.
    \item[Head Hit] Spells/ Visual effects
    \item[Head] Head location for Spells/ Visual effects
    \item[Hand] Point of origin for (some) spells. If the placeable is using a spell/ visual effect this will be the point of origin most of the time.
    \item[Use 1] Use Node for placeables or doors. Upon receiving a use command a character will move to the closest of the two use nodes.
    \item[Use 2] Use Node for placeables or doors. Upon receiving a use command a character will move to the closest of the two use nodes.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Rootdummy}
Each mdl requires at least one Empty: The {\textit{Rootdummy}}. All children
of a {\textit{Rootdummy}} are considered to be part of the same mdl. All
objects which are to be exported have to be a descendant of
the {\textit{Rootdummy}}.

An Empty with the type Dummy and without a parent will autmatically be
considered a Rootummy. The {\textit{Rootdummy}} must have the same name as the
mdl file (minus the files extension). Rootdummys hold additional
information about the model and the Aurora Property panel will
change accordingly.

\begin{description}
    \item[Classification] TODO
    \item[Supermodel] References another mdl file. All animations will be available in this mdl.
    \item[Animationscale] Unknown
\end{description}
It is also used to store the beginning and end frames of specific animations
(walk, run, sit,\ldots). It is not necessary to select the Rootdummy to access these
values, selecting a child of the Rootdummy will do.

\subsubsection{Reference Node}
The purpose and usage of these nodes is unknown. Supposedly it can be used to
reference other mdl files. Reference nodes can be found in some spells and
most of the time references fx\_ref.

\subsubsection{Patch Node}
The purpose and usage of these nodes is unknown. They occur in some spells, but
they seem to behave excatly like normal dummy nodes, i.e they have the same
attributes.

\subsection{Meshes}

\subsubsection{Trimeshes}

\begin{description}
    \item[Wirecolor] Unused in-game
    \item[Self-illumination color] The object glows without actually casting any light.
    \item[Ambient Color] OpenGl material property.
    \item[Shininess]
    \item[Tilefade] Only used it tile-models. Controls the fading of the Tile.
    \item[Render] Controls wether this objects should be rendered in-game. It can still cast a shadow without being rendered.
    \item[Shadow] Controls wether this objects should cast a shadow in-game.
    \item[Beaming]
    \item[Inherit Color]
    \item[Rotate Texture] Used in tile-models.
    \item[Transparency Hint] Used to give the engine an indicator in which order transparency should be calculated. Only relevant if the texutre has transparency.
    \item[Smoothgroup] OpelnGl smoothing.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Danglymeshes}
Danglymeshes are Trimeshes which are"bouncy" or "dangly". They are affected by
wind, character movement and spells. A danglymesh has a set of weights which
determine how far a vertex can be displaced from its original position.

In addition to the properties of a trimesh it has the following properties:
\begin{description}
    \item[Dangle group] The dangle group is a vertex group containing the weights of vertices for the danglymesh. You must select an existing vertex group.
    \item[Period]
    \item[Tightness]
    \item[Displacement]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Skinmeshes}

\subsubsection{Animeshes}
Animmeshes are Trimeshes with animated UV textures. At the moment Animeshes
will be imported as Trimeshes and thus lose their animations.

\subsubsection{Walkmeshes}
Walkmeshes indicate where a character can walk. The type depends on the type
of mdl you want to create.
\begin{description}
    \item[Tileset] Walkmesh for tiles. Use Materials to denote surface type of
                   tile (stone, grass, ...). This will also affect footstep
                   sound and grass growth.
    \item[Door: Closed] The walkmesh for the closed state of the door
    \item[Door: Open 1] The Walkmesh for the first open state of the door
    \item[Door: Open 2] The Walkmesh for the second open state of the door
    \item[Placeable]
\end{description}

\subsection{Emitters}
Support for Emitters is rudimentary. Blenders particle systems is too
different to allow a direct import, instead Emitters are imported as plain
text. While all data will be retained, editing is difficult.

\subsection{Lamps}
